# It's a-maze-ing

During our training at BeCode we were asked to create a program to make a maze game.  

## The aim
We had to be able to create a maze game using only **Javascript** and **CSS** and keeping the **HTML** as simple as possible.  
We had to start by creating level 1 with a defined pattern of 13 by 11, I took the liberty of adding a border so mine is 15 by 13 tiles.  
Level 2 is 24 by 8 tiles and level 3 is 10 by 14.  

## The result
The darkest grey tile is the starting point of the labyrinth, the clouds represent the walls, the picks represent the border and the mushroom '1up' represents the treasure to finish the level. The player is represented by Mario.  

If you collide with a wall or the border, a message will be displayed in the console.  
You can move the player with the directional arrows or with **Z Q S D**.  

The level 1 looks like this:

This is the level 2:
